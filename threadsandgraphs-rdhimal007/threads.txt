The provided starter code and the modified code as instructed, I added a layer where a user could use choose system either local, HPC or Acer. In this way if a data is collected it could be shown together. However, I couldn’t collect the Acer or Polaris since the terminal clone wasn’t working for, so I collected data from personal computer and system2.cs.uic.edu. The graph it produced shows that as a thread count increases the time taken to complete the task decreases with the load. And if there a more core the better the performance would result. In the system2 machine used 8 threads while my personal computer had 12 threads, so it took less time per threads than the system. Or it could also be due to the new hardware like unified memory integration, where systems are older model that gave a different result.
